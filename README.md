# Jackrabbits

This repository is used to store scripts from Leticia Camacho’s MS jackrabbit project. 
It includes old scripts that were developed prior to Spring2023 to assess the spotlight survey data collected in Summer 2022.
These scripts were developed at the beginning learning stage in Leticia’s coding career and jackrabbit project. 
So, they were moved to the Old Scripts folder after the usable code was collected from them and streamlined into new updated scripts in 2023. 

The Andrew Baker folder was created to hold our project’s 2022 undergraduate scripts for his summer project. 
This method and scripts are no longer relevant to the current 2023 project analysis goals. 

The Spotlight Optimization folder will house all the current usable code for working towards analyzing 2022 jackrabbit spotlight survey data 
to determine the optimal spotlight methodology.
